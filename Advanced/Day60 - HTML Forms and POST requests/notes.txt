NOTE: The action attribute of the form can be set to "/login" e.g.
<form action="/login" method="post"> or it can be dynamically generated with url_for e.g.
<form action="{â€Œ{ url_for('receive_data') }}" method="post">
Depending on where your server is hosted, the "/login" path may change. 
So it's usually a better idea to use url_for to dynamically generate the url for a particular function in your Flask server.
