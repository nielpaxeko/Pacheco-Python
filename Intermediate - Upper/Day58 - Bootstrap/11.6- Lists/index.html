                  There are plenty of blink stations at each terminal and the
                  actual blink process is almost instant which leads to very
                  short lines.

                  Even though I don't have a membership, I was able to pay for a ticket on the spot when I needed to flee the city due to.... personal reasons. 100 dollars roundtrip is pretty expensive though, so I would recommend everyone that travels often to at least get the first tier of the subscription.
