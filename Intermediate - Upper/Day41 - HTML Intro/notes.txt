How the Internet works:
- Internet: a long piece of wire that connects different computer to each other
- Computer that is online 24/7, store lots of data -> a server
- Computer that people use -> a client
1. Browser -> send message to ISP -> relay to DNS Server (like a phonebook)
2. DNS Server -> find an IP Address with that domain name, and sends back the IP Address
3. Client -> sends a direct request to the IP Address through the internet backbone
4. Similar to sending mail to friends outside country
5. Server returns back the files and data to the client

How Website works:
- Browser: software that allows you to look up ip address and receive data, rendering them
- Data received: HTML, CSS, JS
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): structure of Website
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): styling of Website
- JS (Javascript): Behaviour of a Website
