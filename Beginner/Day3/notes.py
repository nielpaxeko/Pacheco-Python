# Day 3 Notes - Learning Outcomes

# 1 - CONDITIONAL OPERATORS: IF, ELIF, ELSE
# 2 - MULTIPLE AND NESTED CONDITIONALS USING CONDITIONAL OPERATORS

# 1. CONDITIONAL OPERATORS

# if condition:
#   do this:
# else:
#   do the other one

# EXAMPLE OF IF-ELSE: ROLLERCOASTER HEIGHT LIMIT
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
if height>=120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you are not allowed to ride this rolllercoaster")

# 2. MULTIPLE AND NESTED CONDITIONALS USING CONDITIONAL OPERATORS

# # if condition:
# #   do this:
# # elif condition:
# #   do that:
# # else:
# #   do the other one

# Modulo operator = '%'
# This operator returns the remainder or signed remainder of a division

# # LOGICAL OPERATORS -> and, or, not -> scroll up
