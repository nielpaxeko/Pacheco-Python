# Reproduce the Bug

# or print dice_imgs[dice_num-1]

# Play Computer

elif year >= 1994:
    print("You are a Gen Z.")
# Must include 1994 to be a Gen Z
# >= 1994
# already fixed it too

# Fix the Errors
age = int(input("How old are you?"))

# indentation error -> already fixed it so that its clear
# type error too

# Print is Your Friend
