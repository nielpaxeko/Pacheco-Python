# 1 - FUNCTIONS
# 2 - WHILE LOOPS

# 1. Defining Functions

# Built-in functions
print("Hello")
num_char = len("Hello")
print(num_char)
# etc.


# User-Defined Functions
def myFunction():
    print("Hello")
    print("GoodBye")


# calling the function
myFunction()

# 2. While loops are loops
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
