# This day's project is to create a band name generator that creates a name for a band 
# based on one's hometown and favorite animal.
print("Welcome to the band name generator")
city = input("What city did you grow up in? ")
animal = input("What is your favorite animal? ")
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + animal)
